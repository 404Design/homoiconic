No, I Wouldn't Hire a Programmer That Has No Interest in Programming Outside of Business Hours
===

I read this on [proggit](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/9s3ww/would_you_hire_a_programmer_that_does_not_write/ "Would you hire a programmer that does not write code recreationally? : programming"):

> A while ago my company interviewed someone who, in the course of some standard question, said that after the 5 o'clock whistle blows, they avoid computers totally. They don't have any hobbies involving their PC and often don't turn it on unless they are expecting an important email or need to look up directions. I followed up to ask how they got into programming and they said they took the right courses in college and now has had a few jobs doing it.

> Would you hire a software engineer who isn't a hobbyist programmer? What if they avoid computers totally at home? Does it matter if a candidate has strictly a professional interest in software and just pretends it doesn't exist outside the office?

Here's another way to frame this question: Would I even *interview* a programmer who only works their programming job from 9-5? If not, why not?

The answer is remarkably simple. No, I would not interview them, for the simple reason that I don't know who they are and they don't know who I am. When I am hiring, my first and best source of prospective colleagues is my network. Industry people I know. Where do I get to know people? Conferences. Open source. Blogging. Twitter. I don't advertise my job openings on monster.com. So how did this person come to sit in front of me to tell me he(?) pretends software doesn't exist outside of the office?

I think you have to align your values with your complete hiring process, not just with your interview questions. If you value people who are passionate about their craft, you have to use a different means of selecting prospects than if you value having warm bodies sitting in chairs. If you want a warm body with a certain minimal competence in a chair, you use monster.com and recruiters to find people. if you value community and craft, you use your network and your community.

Done this way, questions like the above tend to take care of themselves.

*Update August 16, 2010*:

If you read the above article closely, it never says that someone who does not involve themselves in programming outside of business hours is not competent or not passionate. It simply says that I use a certain method of getting to know people (call this MY_PEEPS) which in my anecdotal experience leads to a satisfactory number of candidates who have certain competences I desire when hiring (call these SKILLZ). Why do I desire them? Because in my anecdotal experience, a small team with SKILLZ ships SOFTWARE. So my experience is that:

(MY_PEEPS &#8658; SKILLZ) &#8743; (SKILLZ &#8658; SOFTWARE)

I stand by the above, however I think we can all agree that:

&#172;(&#172;MY_PEEPS &#8658; &#172;SKILLZ) &#8743; &#172;(&#172;SKILLZ &#8658; &#172;SOFTWARE)

Or more simply (thanks, [riffraff](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1611275). Loved you in Dark City!):

&#172;(SKILLZ &#8658; MY_PEEPS &#8744; SOFTWARE &#8658; SKILLZ)

Also&#8212;and I think this would be laugh-out-loud-funny if it wasn't so personally painful&#8212;I rarely attend conferences or networking events unless I am invited to give a presentation or participate in a workshop or are otherwise manoevered into some other tangible and explicit commitment. Why? I have social anxiety, and while I am stimulated in an incredibly rich and rewarding way when I meet and talk to people I like and admire, when there are more than a few people in the room I feel incredibly uncomfortable and have to fight the urge to slide out.

The irony of using networking in my career when I'm deathly afraid of one of the most important methods of networking is not lost on me, I can only hope you understand that I am not being hypocritical. Even if it makes me uncomfortable, it works well.
