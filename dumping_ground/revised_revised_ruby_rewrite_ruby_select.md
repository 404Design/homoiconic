Recently I had the honour of sharing a few of my thoughts at [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/ "Stack Overflow")'s Dev Days in Toronto. Joel Spolsky  emailed and suggested that my Ruby.rewrite(Ruby) talk would be interesting. I wouldn't normally re-present the same ideas twice, and that talk was a very specific call-to-action for the Ruby community, so it was easy for both of us to agree that I revise my presentation.

As it happens, I ended up with an almost entirely different presentation. What they had in common was the [conceit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceit "Conceit - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia") of ever "slide" being a legal snippet of Ruby code, and the general topic of meta-programming. (I sincerely hope I am using the word "conceit" properly.)

I'm writing today to share some of my ideas in writing for those who weren't there but are interested in what I was trying to say, and for those who were there and want a recapitulation.

Presentation decks are often useless without the speaker's actual words. In general I think this is a good thing, in that simply reading from the slides is a poor way to present ideas. But I resist trying to write out my exact words (or a close approximation) to accompany the slides. What works with the voice may not work with the written word.

So instead, I am going to touch on a few of the ideas I was trying to share, giving each their own little chunk of prose. Although on stage I tried to link everything together in an overarching presentation, I think in print they can stand alone.

This is something I have read that resonates with me deeply. The study of programming languages is more than just the study of making efficient tools. It's really an indirect way of studying the way we think about solving problems. Programming languages are used to describe a solution in a very concrete, tangible way for the benefit of the computer. So in that way studying languages is a way of studying how we think about solutions to problems. Programming languages are also used to describe solutions to other programmers or domain experts. So in that way studying languages is a way of studying how we think about communicating solutions to problems.

So studying programming languages is a way of studying how we think about programming, and therefore when you think about languages, you are thinking about thinking about programming. And in turn, that strikes me as being a way to think about thinking, to think about part of what makes us human. I think that's worthwhile.

My entire discussion defining "meta-linguistic programming," discussing program language semantics, and comparing linguistics to abstractions originally appeared here as [Meta-Linguistic Programming](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2009-10-08/metalinguistic.md).

[Meta-Linguistic Programming](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2009-10-08/metalinguistic.md) ends with a section called "Abstractioneering," and I re-presented this basic idea during the talk as well.
