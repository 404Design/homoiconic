I don't care why you won't write for iPhone
===

Dear Independent Software Vendor ("ISV"):

I understand you don't want to write an application for iPhone. You don't want to be one of Apple's sharecroppers. [I get it, I really do](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2004/11/sharecropping-in-orchard.html "Sharecropping in the Orchard"). The thing is, I don't give a flying fecal clod about why you don't want to write an iPhone application. Really, I don't.

And please don't start in with the Apple Fanboi nonsense. I also don't give a coital conglomeration about why someone won't develop for Android or for Windows or for OS X or for Linux or on Rails or with PHP or whatever else. All of you folks writing those blog posts, please, do yourselves and me a favour and just stop it!

Here's what to do. You want to write software? Pick your tools, pick your platform, and **write**. I wanna see your stuff, I wanna applaud your efforts. I like you, and I really want to like your app. So write it already! Write it and write about it!! But this kind of hissy fit post about what you *won't* do? Come on, writing about that can't be the most important thing you'll do today.

Don't get me wrong, I realize your post will attract a jillion upvotes and a rolling thunderclap of comments on sites like Hacker News. But really, will your post be one of the ones people bookmark and come back to re-read in a month or a year? Or is it just the flavour-of-the-day for people taking a break from creating stuff?

And you can rationalize that you're providing information for other developers trying to decide what to do. But that's all hooey. The fact is, everyone already knows what the pertinent issues surrounding platform and tool choice are. Anyone deciding what to do based on blog posts... They're more interested in following the herd than making a rational decision. And they aren't even necessarily following the herd, they're following whomever has the most entertaining writing style.
