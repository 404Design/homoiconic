Homoiconic
===

* _n_ compile-run cycles such that metaprogramming affects the compile and is static during the run. ANd the _n_ cycles are strictly leveled such that the only think cycle _n_ can do is meta-program cycle _n_-1.
* metaprogramming is always local
* metaprogramming always tied to the debugger/stack such that we don't have the debugging problem. we aren't just writing a new program, we're reprogramming the interpreter
