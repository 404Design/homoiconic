RewriteRails
===

A few days ago I wrote about [RewriteRails](http://github.com/raganwald/rewrite_rails/tree/master "raganwald's rewrite_rails at master &mdash; GitHub"). I have written up some documentation and as of now, I am asking absolutely everyone--this means you--to install it into your project. The best way to move it--and Ruby as a whole--forward is to make this bullet-proof.

Now, RewriteRails is not for everyone. Kindly pass this message on to some more deserving soul if you:

* Don't use Rails
* Don't use Object#andand or String#to_proc

But if you are using `Object#andand` or `String#to_proc` in a Rails project, please consider an upgrade to RewriteRails. You can back out at any time, the plugin has been specifically engineered so that you are **never** locked in to it. Email if you would like to set up a VNC session to get it installed in your project.
