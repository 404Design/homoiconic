Eyes of Wood, Hands of Stone, Heart of Paper
===

A while back, I tried to play Go. As I recounted in my post, [High Anxiety][anxiety], it did not go well. Since then, I tried to let go of myself and learn the game as others suggested. For starters, I purchased a few games for my iPhone and played many times. That went nowhere in a certain sense: I reached a certain level and progress ceased immediately. I also tried going online and playing people at the bottom of the online rankings on 9x9 boards. I lost <u>every</u> game, no matter who I played.

I played with my friend on 9x9 and 13x13 boards with huge handicaps. Because of the disparity in our abilities, every game felt like a military retreat. The objective was to lose slowly enough that the game would end before she could destroy everything I had. If I lost too quickly, she would have more territory at the end of the game. If the board was larger, the game lasted longer, and therefore I needed more of a handicap so that my pace of losing would come close enough to the longer length of the game to put the outcome in doubt.

I went along with this for a little while, but honestly the experience was unsatisfying. I was able to put my ego aside and accept that as a novice I am supposed to lose. However, there is some weird sense of aesthetics I have where I dislike the character of a game that involves an ongoing retreat. It rankled me that I was making terrible moves. I felt like playing me was tempting my friend to make moves that would normally be considered very poor, but would succeed against me by drawing me into elementary traps. Clearly, playing me might have social value for her, but I failed to see what our games could teach her about Go.

**humbility**

To play Go, one needs a huge amount of humility and patience. At first I thought I lacked these qualities, but then a funny thing happened: I purchased my first-ever mountain bike:

Now, I have a lot of cycling experience, almost as much cycling experience as I have playing strategy games. However, I am interested in learning new things, so I am learning Freeride and Trials skills. Like how to ride along a narrow, elevated "skinnie" or how to negotiate a tight hairpin by locking up the brakes and hopping or pivoting the bike, using the wheels like feet.

Once again, I'm a pre-novice. Small children effortlessly bunny hop their bikes onto and over obstacles while I struggle to get the front wheel off the ground. After an entire summer of this, I'm much better than when I went on my first ride, but I'm still terrible in comparison to nearly everyone else I've ever seen.

However, I really, really enjoy riding the new bike, but I don't enjoy Go. What is the difference?

**learning style**

I think it's really simple. Cycling skills require performing with the conscious mind turned off. You can't think your way over a pile of logs. Either your body has learned what to do, or it hasn't. Performance is an unconscious skill. However, learning what to do is not an unconscious skill. You learn by observing what someone does, breaking it into small pieces, practicing the pieces, putting them together, analyzing feedback...

There are probably great riders who learn unconsciously as well, but I know for a fact that it is possible to learn the basic skills consciously, because that's what I've been doing.

This seems to differ for me in Go, because I have been unable to consciously learn. I have read books with problems, I have played, I have backed up games and replayed positions, but in the end it seems to resist breaking into small pieces that can be learned so well that they become unconscious. (Another possibility is that it takes longer than a year to discover that you've learned anything).

Either way, the big difference between the two activities is that in cycling, I receive regular positive feedback. A competitive part of me would love to be able to use other people as ticks on a measuring stick: "I'm better than Frank but not as good as Tony." Not yet, for now I measure my improvement with little things like occasionally feeling myself hit the balance point when working on a "1/2-1/4 to manual wheelie drop." Or popping the front wheel up onto a bench and driving the rear wheel up and under me.

In Go, I received no such affirmation. I play, I lose, and games are too long to be able to identify the specific mistakes without extensive personal coaching. I simply don't know whether I am succeeding or failing when I make a move unless it's a spectacular blunder. Problems are a far better fit with my personality, because I know right away whether I succeed or fail.

I have a similar reaction to climbing, another passion of mine. I have gradually lost interest in doing routes in the gym. In a route, it's very obvious if you fail spectacularly, because you fall. But you can fail in a subtle way. For example, you can do a move poorly, wasting energy or placing too much stress on the upper body and hands when you could have used your feet more effectively. This can deceive you: I have seen intermediate climbers fail high on a route, and announce to me that they lacked the strength or endurance to do the move.

My response is sometimes to question how they moved much lower on the route. I observe that they were climbing very inefficiently, and thus by the time they reached the 'hard' move, they were tired. This leads either directly to failing when they attempt to do the hard move correctly but lack the strength, or indirectly to failing when their lack of strength and mental exhaustion lead them to believe that the correct way to do the move is "impossible," therefore they attempt outlandish alternatives to the move.

So in climbing routes, it is sometimes difficult to know what you are doing wrong. One way around this is to climb with someone good enough to give you feedback. Another way is to boulder, to work on very short problems that are at your limit of skill. If you do something poorly, you fall right off a bouldering problem. Thus, any mistake is punished immediately and success is rewarded immediately. Go is not like bouldering at all. Cycling is like bouldering.

What conclusion do I draw? I think I am a very simple person, with a simple, dog-like need for immediate feedback. I have no experience learning through osmosis, learning by imitating people without trying to understand what I am imitating. This is not a good fit for Go, at all. I am not a subtle person with deep wisdom and infinite patience.

> "I cannot forecast to you the action of Russia. It is a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma; but perhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest." --Winston Churchill, October 1939

Go presents itself as a mystery, and as you try to learn, it gives no feedback.

**what to do?**

Some people find this quality of Go delightful. The mysteries, the necessity for putting away the conscious learning mind to learn to play the game. I don't. I can appreciate intellectually that other people find this delightful, and I do not argue. However, if I close my eyes I can't actually empathize with them, I have no appreciation for the pleasure of learning in this way.

> It could be that I will never present a challenge to anyone, perhaps I will always lose no matter how many stones I am given. I don't know, but I do know that when I next sit in front of a Go board, I will enjoy myself. 

I wrote that I would teach myself to enjoy playing Go. Well, I have good news and bad news. I no longer feel terrified, or angry, or anxious when playing Go. I can lose without pain. However, I don't enjoy it, it's just time passing. My friend challenged me on this. If I don't enjoy Go, why am I learning to play? I thought about this, and I can find no retort. There's the social stigma of being born without the "Go" gene. I will learn to live with the shame. Other programmers will whisper at conference, "Yes, he writes well, *but he can't play Go*."

So, I have stopped playing. I didn't get as far as enjoying it, but it was a big victory to become indifferent to my helplessness. In the future, I may pick it up again, perhaps at some point Go will give something to me, there will be some reward of some kind for playing.

**wood & stones**

Oh yeah, I forgot to mention the most important thing about failing to learn to enjoy Go. The most important thing is that along the way I started writing a Goban, a program to turn your iPad into a Go board for playing face to face. If you're reading this in Mobile Safari, you can try it now by clicking [Wood & Stones][ws] or any of the screenshots.

[![Choose a Game][http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/raw/master/2010/08/wood_and_stones/choosegame.png]][ws]

Wood & Stones is an HTML5/CSS3/JS application. That means that you don't need to download it from the Apple Store, you can visit the link and play. It also means that once you've clicked the link, you can save it to your iPad's home screen and play it offline. Take it to the park, enjoy a game with a friend on a park bench.

I know that there's a lot of action playing Go online. So I could have written a client for one of the popular sites. But I didn't see much upside in that. I'd like to integrate it with [Dave Peck's Go][peck]. If you don't know what that is, "go" there now and play!

But back to Wood & Stones. I went with a gestural interface. For example, to review the history of the game, you swipe the screen just like turning pages in a book. It was interesting to develop a minimal user interface using gestures, and it also felt like I was writing an application that had the simplicity of Go. It just feels *wrong* to me to have such a simple game be represented on the screen with so many controls that a 747 pilot would feel at home.

It's still a work in progress. I'm doing the help screens at the moment. But the most important thing is for you to try it. Let me know what you think. If you don't have an iPad, try it using Apple Safari. If you don't have Safari, try it using a modern browser and let's see how it goes.

[![Help][http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/raw/master/2010/08/wood_and_stones/wshelp.png]][ws]

So in the end, something very good came out of this exercise: I wrote some interesting [code for Wood & Stones][wscode]. Wood & Stones also emitted [iGesture][ig], a jQuery plugin for writing gestural interfaces, and  [jQuery Combinators][jqc], a jQuery plugin that makes your code deeply beautiful. That's satisfying.

So, enjoy Go!
