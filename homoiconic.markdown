Homoiconic
---

Well, I said I was [retiring from blogging](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/07/brief-history-of-dangerous-ideas.html"A Brief History of Dangerous Ideas") and here I am with what looks like a new blog. What's going on?

[Homoiconic](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/) *is* a kind of blog, if you define blog as 'something published on the internet with an RSS feed.' But no, this is not a blog in the sense that [weblog.raganwald.com](http://weblog.raganwald.com) was a blog. [Homoiconic](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/) is an experiment in publishing code and words about code on a small scale.

This is really simple: snippets of code and words about the code. No words by themselves. And the words exist to amplify and explain the code, rather than the code existing to illustrate the words. This is the opposite of most of the posts you find on traditional (circa 2004) blogs.

If you want to see what else you can read, it's all on the [homoiconic](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/) home 'page.'

**how to read it**

When I write, I will add files to the [homoiconic](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/) git repository, organized by date. Code will be included in the posts and also in the folder with the posts that discuss them, so it's easy to download what you like. You can even download the entire thing as an archive if you want.

I will be tagging new 'posts' in [del.icio.us](http://delicious.com/raganwald/homoiconic "Homoiconic Bookmarks on Delicious"). You can subscribe to [an RSS feed that will alert you when I manually tag a new post](http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/raganwald/homoiconic "Homoiconic Bookmarks Feed"). If you do this, you will need to manually check posts for updates, or come back here to the [home page](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic "Homoiconic on GitHub").

If you're into git and like fine-grained updates, you can follow [homoiconic](http://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic) here on GitHub or [subscribe to commit messages](http://github.com/feeds/raganwald/commits/homoiconic/master "Recent Commits to homoiconic") letting you know what I've added or updated in your feed reader. The latter option is likely to be moderate volume, as I like to make edits and corrections as I go.

**advocacy-free**

My writing used to be heavily philosophical, with lots of advocacy and questioning. I still consider the _why_ of things much more meaningful than the how, but it's time to focus on the how rather than the why. I'm making this little writing place a "no trolling zone." I will try to avoid preaching, and the obvious corollary is that I will also avoid worrying about whether people agree or disagree. Instead, I will try to simply share little pieces of code as it comes to me.

There is no advocacy on here. I frequent a few scuba diving forums. One annoying part of scuba culture is that it can be very polarizing. A bunch of people over here say there is only One True Way to dive, right down to using the exact same equipment as each other. Another bunch of people over there disregard the conventional wisdom and choose to dive solo, attracting criticism from young and old. The forums discovered a long time ago that running flame wars simply drove members away, so they have instituted "no trolling" zones within their boards, places where people can discuss the _how_ of solo diving, or sidemounting, or DIR, without getting into a battle of whether such a thing is a good idea or not.

So, one of the reasons there is no advocacy is that I am hoping to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. That being said, what is noise to one person is music to another, so I have no problem with people using their blogs or community sites like [ruby.reddit](http://ruby.reddit.com) to express their feelings.

The other reason there is no advocacy is that I am invoking the "Transit Cop Cop-Out" on myself:

> I used to commute into Toronto on the GO train. They have an honour system: you can buy a monthly pass or purchase tickets that you punch yourself before boarding. Roving transit cops check your ticket, and if you didn't punch it you get a $90 fine. Of course, the miscreants have a litany of excuses "I forgot," "I left my pass in my other tuxedo," and so forth.

> When you ride every day you get to know the cops well. One of them told me that he had a policy of letting people off Scot-free if they told him a story he hadn't heard before. He told me that the last novel excuse he had heard was from a woman who claimed her nails were too wet to reach into her bag, remove the ticket, and punch it before boarding. Nice. He said he let her off on the grounds of novelty and chutzpah.

I have already said a number of things about [abstractions](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/07/abbreviation-accidental-complexity-and.html"Abbreviation, Accidental Complexity, and Abstraction"), [functional programming](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/03/why-why-functional-programming-matters.html"Why Why Functional Programming Matters Matters"), [meta-programming](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/07/my-analyst-warned-me-but.html"My analyst warned me, but metaprogramming was so beautiful I got another analyst"), [metaprogramming again](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/03/spaghetti-western-coding.html"Spaghetti-Western Coding"), [brevity](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/12/golf-is-good-program-spoiled.html"Golf is a good program spoiled"), and [much more](http://delicious.com/raganwald/raganwald.popular"Popular posts from weblog.raganwald.com"). But I don't want to say any more on subjects like these until I can think of something *novel*. It may be awhile. In the meantime, share and enjoy.

**no comments**

At the moment, there are no comments. This is a blog about code, not words. I welcome bug reports and other code-centric feedback by email. I would be delighted to post your snippets and examples.

**credit where credit is due**

I originally set up a blog at homoiconic.com, but I spotted [David Baldwin's blog](http://github.com/bilson/blog/tree/master), and I knew right away that a blog that is about the how of code ought to be hosted on Github.

I am [Reg Braithwaite](http://reginald.braythwayt.com/). You can reach me by email. My first name is `reg`, and that works fine for sending email to `braythwayt.com`. I look forward to hearing from you.
