Bah, Humbug!
===

More than a few people have asked whether I will move homoiconic to [GitHub Pages](http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages "GitHub Pages &mdash; GitHub"). In short, the answer is **no**. When I first looked at doing this on Github, I thought long and hard about a number of solutions for publishing a blog to a static site, including Jekyl, the code that powers Github Pages.

In the end, I decided against making a "real blog," because I wanted to focus on the code and not the words. Every minute I spend fooling around with a page template or a CSS style sheet is a minute I am not spending writing code or words about code. Furthermore, I like the gritty, stripped-down UI of looking at this directly in GitHub. It ought to feel like you are browsing files on my Mac, not reading pages on my blog.

I hope that over time you will grow to like reading it in this minimalist format as much as I like writing it.
